🤞-trust<br>
Trust measures your predisposition to believe people are fundamentally fair, well-intentioned, and honest. Trust upfront is an integral part of relationship building, with extremely low levels of trust leading to unhealthy cynicism. With this in mind, leveling trust focuses on your ability to be willing to forgive and forget when people falter, or ability to distinguish when to be skeptical versus when to not be.

😰-anxiety<br>
Anxiety is a measurement of your tendency to feel something unpleasant, threatening, or dangerous. Anxiety is routed in our ‘fight-or-flight’ system of our brains, and can be thought of as the measurement of triggering unpleasant, threatening, or dangerous feelings.

😞-depression<br>
Depression is the range of your tendency to react to life’s suffering, and the amount of time spent thinking about the things you are unhappy about. Clinical depression is a complicated issue that can only be diagnosed by a professional evaluation, so leveling depression focuses on developing your ability to be resilient to life’s ups and downs.<br><br>

🍩-immoderation<br>
Immoderation measures your willpower to resist or give in to temptations you are likely to regret later. Leveling immoderation allows you to abstain from short-term pleasures for long-term rewards and outcomes, and develop a sense of self-control to reduce intensity in temptations.<br><br>
